# React + Vite
Creating a weather app with API calls in React is highly useful. It allows to:

- **Learn API Integration**:  Fetch and display real-time weather data.
- **Understand Component Structure**:  Build reusable components for different parts of the app.
- **Manage State Effectively**:  Use state to manage data and UI updates.
- **Work with Lifecycle Methods**:  Handle component lifecycle for fetching data at the right times.
- **Implement Error Handling**:  Manage and display errors from API calls.

This project helps me strengthen my React skills, providing hands-on experience with real-world applications.

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
