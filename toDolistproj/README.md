# React + Vite
A to-do list mini project is an excellent way to learn React. It helps to:

- Understand core concepts: Component creation, state management, and props.
- Practice handling inputs: Manage dynamic data and update the UI in real-time.
- Explore advanced features: Hooks and context.

This project is manageable and insightful, providing a solid foundation in React development.

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
